I haven't done much blogging for a while due - in part - to the enormous amount of Spam my blog was attracting. But I just updated the software and installed a spam filter. I plan to start posting again, and re-open the blog to comments. Hopefully, the spam won't overwhelm me this time.

Since I last wrote, NUnit 2.4.3 and 2.4.4 have come out as well as NUnitLite 0.1 and 0.2. I'll blog separately about the status of each of those.
