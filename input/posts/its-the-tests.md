_It's the Tests_ was my blog about Agile software development, Extreme Programming and Test Driven Development for many years. I have gone through the posts and included those that I feel may still be of interest under the "It's the Tests" tag on this site. The entries have been edited lightly, to fix broken links. I have kept some comments and removed others tht no longer seem relevant today.
