<p class="comment">This page contains notes about the life of my uncle Tom, my father's brother,
whom I knew as a child. In addition to information found in my research, I have
freely mixed in observations based on my own memories. It's also a work in progress
and I'll update it as I get more information.</p>

Tom was born on August 20, 1914, the youngest child of William and Mary Poole.
At the time, they were living in Brooklyn, most likely at 174 Hull Street. In
any case, we do know they were at that address 10 months later when the 1915
New York State Census was taken. It was an apartment building, with four other 
families living there at the same address. I haven't found a picture from the
back then, but here is a present day

William died in 1918. Thomas was then three and a half years old so he probably
had only vague memories of his father. Shortly thereafter, his mother moved the
family to 29 Euclid Street in Cyprus Hills, close to the border between Broolyn
and Queens. By January 1920, when the US Census is taken, they have moved again,
this time a bit farther: to Holy Child Jesus parish in Queens.

Their first address in Queens, 257 128th Street, is a bit of a mystery, since it
no longer exists today and is not even in the proper form of present-day Queens
addresses. In fact, addresses were being reassigned right about that time. I believe
that their next recorded address, 8479 127th Street, is actually the same house
but so far I have no definitive evidence. Here is what that address
[looks like today.](https://goo.gl/maps/8pXS2bU28dwk6fVr8)

Uncle Tom seems to have been a very bright child. According to the 1920 census,
he was able to read but not yet write at age five. His mother or siblings
must have taught him, since he didn't actually enter school until 1922, when
he had just turned eight.

That school was the Holy Child Jesus School, the same school my sister and I
attended as children. It had been constructed just a few years before, opening
its doors in September 1917. Coincidentally, the 111th Street station of the
BMT elevated line along Jamaica Avenue had just opened a few months earlier.

Thomas appears on the published Honor Roll in second grade, the only record
of him I have been able to find. We would have graduated from eighth grade
in 1926 and from high school in 1932. Census data tells us that was the extent
of his formal education, which was pretty much normal for the period and for
most Poole family members who did not enter religious orders.

At some point during the period from 1925 to 1930, Mary Head managed to purchase
a home at 8782 115th Street, the first house owned by the family. That house
is very familiar to me since I frequently visited my aunts there as a child.
The location was much more central in the parish, only a few minutes walk
from the church and school.

In August 1932, when he was 17 years old, Tom's sister Agnes died. She was 31
and her death made a big impression on the family, continuing through my own
childhood and even later.

At the time of the 1940 census, Tom is 26 and is working for the Department
of Commerce, Bureau of Marine inspection as a stenographer. He is also active
in the church and in January 1942 is elected Secretary of the Holy Child Jesus
Men's club.

A month later, however, he is drafted and enters the army. He serves in
Fort Dix, New Jersey, and rises to the rank of Staff Sergeant. He wrote home
regularly and his granddaughter, was able to safeguard the letters. They are
interesting reading and give a picture of everyday life at the time.

Tom was discharged from the army in October 1943. A few months later, in January
1944, his mother Mary died. Of course this was an enormous blow to the family.
Brothers Jim and Jack, both priests, officiated at the requiem mass in Holy Child
Jesus church.

Thomas became active again in the parish. In October 1944 he represented the Holy
Child Jesus men's club in a debate against a team from another parish. The topic
was raising the subway fare to five cents. His team drew the affirmative position,
arguing that the fare should be raised. They lost.

On May 3, 1945, Thomas and Eileen Jane Byrnes got a marriage license from the
City of New York and married shortly thereafter. I have not been able to find
a record the date and place of the wedding. Eileen was the proverbial "girl
next door" - her parents lived a few houses along the street from the Pooles.
or at least down the street. It's not clear where they lived immediately
after the marriage, but it could have been with either family.

Shortly afterwards, newspaper records show Tom continuing to be very active in
the Catholic Debating League, but associated with a different parish. In October
of 1945 he chairs a debate at Our Lady of Perpetual Help church in South Ozone
Park. In December,the Holy Name Society at OLPH names him chairman of their
debating team. One article refers to him as a former member of the Holy Child
Jesus team.

In July of 1946, Thomas is elected Secretary of the Catholic Debating League
of the Diocese of Brooklyn. This was a pretty big deal. Today the diocese covers
Brooklyn and Queens but before 1957 it included all of Long Island. Tom's 
experience as a stenographer probably made him a natural choice as secretary,
but it clearly would not have happened unless he was seen as a strong and steady
member of the community.

We don't know why Tom changed parishes around 1945-46. The most likely explanation
is that he moved into the new parish but we don't yet have that information.

On March 8 1947 Tom and Eileen's daughter was born. She was named Eileen Jane.
following the Irish tradition of naming the first-born daughter after the mother.
Eileen was one of the few cousins my sister and I actually knew. In the 1950s,
Uncle Tom, aunt Eileen and cousin Eileen would come to see us. Tom owned a car
and we would occasionally take trips "out to Long Island." Two places I remember
visiting with them were Valley Stream State Park and a sort of roadhouse in
Oyster Bay. The latter had nice grounds and play equipment and we were all able
to play under our mothers' eyes while the two brothers had beers inside.

One hint about living arrangements shows up in a 1948 personal add in _The Tablet_:

At the moment, this is only an interesting clue, but if "Mrs. Poole" in the ad is
actually Tom's wife, then it would mean they were looking for a place to live. The
telephone exchange appears to be in the Shore Road area of Brooklyn, in case that
may serve as an additional hint.

Sadly, I have almost no information about the remainder of Tom's life. His brother
William, the eldest son of the family, died in 1950 and Jack died in 1952. Tom
himself passed away in 1964.

At the time of Uncle Tom's passing I was 22. I spoke briefly with Eileen at the
funeral and didn't see her again for over 40 years. But that's for another post.
