Title: Family History

I grew up with surprisingly little information about the history of my family and
the people I might have asked have all passed away. As a result, I've taken to genealogy
as a way to fill in the gaps. In this part of my web site, I am recording the information
I have found along with personal stories and memories about the family.

#### External Sites

I use several genealogy sites for my research. You can view the trees on each of them
but will need to set up an account first. A free account works fine. You will not be
able to see details of living persons right away because of privacy concerns but if
you're a member of the family and email me I'll be happy to give you the necessary
permissions.
