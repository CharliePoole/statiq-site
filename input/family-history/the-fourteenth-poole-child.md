Title: The Fourteenth Poole Child

As children, my sister and I had always been  told that there were 
fourteen children in my father's family, but we only knew the names
of thirteen of them. We both remember being told that there was
another child who had died, but that was the limit of our knowledge.

Until now!

Yesterday, in doing a search for information about grandfather William
W Poole, I came across a death record with his name on it. Not _his_ death,
but that of one of his children.

As I found out subsequently, the problem of "missing children" is
well-known. Since a great deal of our genealogical information comes from
census data, anyone who was born and died in the interval between two censuses
doesn't show up without a special effort being made.

In this case, Thomas A Poole was born in June 1907 and died two months
later. His entire life fell between the 1905 New York State Census and
the 1910 US Census. Baby Thomas' death certificate gives _murasmus_ as
the cause of death. This is a form of malnutrition most prominent in
children under the age of one. There can be a number of underlying causes
and we have no information as to why this happened to baby Tom, but it's
frequently associated with poverty.

Aside from resolving the mystery of the fourteenth child, this sad
event tells us several new things about the family. For one thing,
we now know that the name Thomas, subsequently given to the fourteenth
child in the family, comes from this baby. This was a very common 
practice in Irish-Catholic families: the name of a child who had died
would be reused when the next child of the same sex was born.

It also explains why there seemed to be a gap in record of births. Mary
Poole had been bearing children at  the rate of about one per year.
Of course this is shocking today but it was fairly normal at the time
in Catholic families, with abstinence considered to be the only acceptable
means of contraception. In that light, the absence of a child in 1907 always
seemed a little suprising and now we know why.

Finally, this record gives us yet another address where the family lived.
The death certificate contains the address 53 Georgia Avenue, one we had
not previously seen. While the specific address means little to us, it
accentuates the picture we already had of an expanding family needing to
constantly search for new places to live.

<p class="comment">After stumbling across this new information, I eventually
found an article telling how to perform a similar search deliberately.
