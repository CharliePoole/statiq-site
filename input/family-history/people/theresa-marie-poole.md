My daughter Marie was born on December 7, 1969. Her naming is the topic of a
family story often retold.

My wife's preferred name for the child about to be born was Maria Theresa. I
preferred Theresa Marie, so as to name her after her mother. In typical fashion,
I convinced myself that we had agreed on my choice and the name was recorded 
while her mother was in a semi-conscious state in the hospital.

Of course, Marie herself had the last word and calls herself Marie today. I think
it worked out well.
