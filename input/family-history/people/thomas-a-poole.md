Thomas A Poole was born on June 21 20, 1907, the sixth child of William and Mary Poole. He died only a few months later, on September 5 1907.

According to the death certificate, Thomas died of _murasmus_, a form of malnutrition
most frequently observed in children under one year.

As was customary, the name Thomas was again used when the next male child was born. That
was Thomas John Poole, born in 1914.
