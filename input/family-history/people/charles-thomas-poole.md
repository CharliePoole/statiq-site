<p class="comment">This page contains notes about my father's life. In addition to
genealogical information found in my research, I have mixed in my own memories.
It's a work in progress, which I'll update as I get more information.</p>

Charles Thomas Poole was born on January 3, 1903, the fifth child of William and
Mary Poole. At the time of his birth, they lived in Brooklyn, at either 452 16th
Street or 1728 Pacific Street. The  two addresses are recorded in census data of
1900 and 1905 but we don't actually know when the family moved from one to the other.
