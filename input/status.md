Title: Site Status

### What's Here

This new version of the `CharliePoole.org` site is pulling together posts, articles
and other pages, which were originally scattered in various locations. It's a work
in progress and this page will continue to list what's done and what remains to do
until the migration is complete.

### What's Done

* Implemented the new site using `Statiq`. It is statically generated and most material
  is in the form of blog posts.

* Implemented "Topics" for the site. Every blog post belongs to a single topic and posts
  for each topic are saved in a separate directory. The URLs also incorporate the topic.
  Currently, there are three topics: `Technical Posts`, `Family Photos` and `Family History`.
  Tags are also used and generally apply within a single topic, although that is not
  a restriction.

* Moved most posts in my `It's the Tests` blog on `charliepoole.com` to this site under
  the `Technical Posts` topic. Posts about NUnit V2 were re-tagged `NUnit V2` while general
  NUnit posts and those about NUnit 3 keep the `NUnit` tag. I dropped simple announcements,
  without other content and a few that contain content, which is now incorrect or misleading.
  The old blog now contains only a notice about this move.

* Added a `Site Status` page (this one).

* Automated rebuild and deployment of the site.

* Added background images to the home page and each main topic page.

### Ongoing

* Port technical articles and remove them from `CharliePoole.com`.
  **Current Status:** Completed **1 out of 13** articles.

### To Do

#### General

* Add a contact page

* Update the `About` page, shortening it and linking it to my bio and resume as separate pages.

* Add social media links.

* Decide whether to support comments on blog posts and how.

* Possibly, expand topics to allow nesting. For example, a `Family` Topic
  might include both `Family History` and `Family Photos`.

#### Technical Content

* Move important past events as post-dated blog posts.

* Create downloads of some of my presentations.

* Add pagination to the `Technical Posts` topic, which contains a large number of posts.
  The two `Family` topics will eventually need this as well.

* Remove the old `.com` site and point the URL to the new site.

#### Family Content

* Add additional `Family` content.

#### Travel Posts

* Add a `Travel` topic and add content.
