Title: Site Status

### What's Here

This new version of the `CharliePoole.org` site is pulling together posts, articles
and other pages, which were originally scattered in various locations. It's a work
in progress and this page will continue to list what's done and what remains to do
until the migration is complete.

### What's Done

* Implemented the new site using `Statiq`. It is statically generated and most material
  is in the form of blog posts.

* Implemented "Topics" for the site. Every blog post belongs to a single topic and posts
  for each topic are saved in a separate directory. The URLs also incorporate the topic.
  Currently, there are three topics: `Technical Posts`, `Family Photos` and `Family History`.
  Tags are also used and generally apply within a single topic, although that is not
  a restriction.

* Moved posts in my `It's the Tests` blog to this site under `Technical Posts` with the
  tag `It's the Tests` in addition to the subject tags they already had. A few posts were
  dropped, mostly announcements of other articles, which will be moved here anyway.

* Added a `Site Status` page (this one).

### Ongoing

* Check all old posts for broken links and fix.

### To Do

* Remove the old blog posts from `CharliePoole.com` and leave a notice there.

* Add background images to (at least) the index pages.

* Update my bio on the site and possibly move elsewhere.

* Automate rebuilding and deploying the site.

* Port technical articles and remove them from `CharliePoole.com`.

* Add pagination to the `Technical Posts` topic, which contains a large number of posts.
  The two `Family` topics will eventually need this as well.

* Decide whether to support comments on blog posts and how.

* Remove the old `.com` site and point the URL to the new site.

* Add additional `Family` content.

* Add a `Travel` topic and add content.
