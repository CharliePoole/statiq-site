With a European trip about to start, I decided to release a second Alpha so that the new stuff would get some visibility. I won't be doing another release till late June, so please [give this one a try](http://nunit.org/download).

As compared to 2.4, NUnit 2.5 has quite a lot:

* Data-driven tests using [TestCase] and [DataSource]
* Additional asserts and constraints, including inline exception tests.
* Parallel and distributed testing using pNUnit.
* Bundled addins, now including RowTest and CSUnitAddin.


For more info, see the [release notes](http://docs.nunit.org/2.5/releaseNotes.html).

In addition, watch the NUnit mailing lists or this blog for info about other extensions as they are released for NUnit 2.5.
