Title: "Getting NUnit in China"

A Chinese programmer (anonymous until he tells me otherwise) recently wrote to ask me for a copy of NUnit 2.2.7. For some reason, it appears that Sourceforge is not accessible in China. This seems odd to me, since it's hardly a political site, but the ways of bureaucracy in any country can be hard to fathom.

Anyway, rather than simply sending a copy, I asked him to help me set up a site that he he and others could access. After experimenting with various urls, we were able to ascertain that a download page on my personal site would work. So now I've set up I've set up a special page for use by programmers in countries that can't use Sourceforge.

>Of course, anyone can use this page, but I hope those who are able to use Sourceforge will continue to do so. The Sourceforge site maintains statistics on NUnit downloads that I haven't taken the time to implement on my personal site.

Have others working in open source projects run into this problem? What have you done about it? Is there a better place - perhaps someplace central - to put downloads so that these guys can get them?

It could be. Or it also may depend on the proxy that is used.

I live in HK and I've asked a friend live in China (Beijing) to test , and he can download it from Sourceforge, may be it just a connection problem of one of Sourceforge mirror?

I've heard that from other folks as well... For that reason, I'm no longer keeping the separate download page up to date with new versions, but I'll put them up if anyone asks.

Thanks for your help to Chinese programmer, Charlie.
The Sourceforge is not accessible in China sometimes for some reason,  which I don't want to say.
So, your help is useful for someone.

My English is very poor, I hop you can understand my expression.
