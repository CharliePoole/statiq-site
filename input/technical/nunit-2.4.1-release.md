I just released NUnit 2.4. It fixes a few issues that slipped into the 2.4 release an makes some minor improvements. I wanted to get this release out because I'll be travelling for a few months and won't be in a position to do further releases until July or August.

You can review the[Release Notes](https://docs.nunit.org/2.4.1/releaseNotes.html) for more info about the contents of this release. You can download it from NUnit.org.

[...] I upgraded from NUnit 2.2.9 to NUnit 2.4.1 and while there is all sorts of new goodness added (much of which I don&#8217;t yet use) I am quite disappointed in performance. The actual speed of each test hasn&#8217;t changed, but it takes longer than before to start running the tests and, more annoyingly, it takes an age to close the form. This is quite a hindrance because, I really want to be able to switch quickly between running/debugging a test and then modifying the code. Obviously, this isn&#8217;t possible when it takes 10-15 seconds to close! Hopefully, this will be fixed soon or I will probably revert back to a previous version. [...]

I've got a bit of a problem.

1) Error: 'Use named parameter format 'ExpectedMessage=...'

2) Error: Name 'ExpectedMessage' is not declared.

3) It's only like this in VB.NET and not in C#, can't find where ExpectedMessage is defined.
