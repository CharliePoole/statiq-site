NUnit 2.4.2 is out and available <a href="http://nunit.org/?p=download">here</a>. It includes additions to the new constraint-based Assert syntax and new attributes to facilitate testing under various culture settings. The gui has been enhanced to save the visual state of the tree, including the currently selected test, and to allow loading just the fixture you are working on, which saves a great deal of time on reloads.
