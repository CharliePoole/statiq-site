#### About Me

On the personal level, I'm a retired guy with four children and three grandchildren. I live
in Pouslbo, a small town across Puget Sound from Seattle. Aside from family, my interests
include Travel, Walking, Reading, Photography and Genealogy. I love languages, speak French
and Italian fairly well and dabble in a few others. When I was younger, I did a lot of sailing
and skiing as well but I'm not so physically active these days.

Professionally, I've been developing software in one role or another since 1974. I started as
an employee and later became an independent consultant, trainer and coach. I've worked around
the US and in Europe and am now pretty much retired.

Beginning around 2001, I got involved in the Agile development movement, primarily
Extreme Programming. I was active in the international XP conferences and had the privilege of
learning from some of the true experts and innovators in the field.

I have been very active in Open Source, particularly with the NUnit Project, the longest-lived
project of it's type in the .NET world. These days, my focus is primarily on TestCentric, which
I intend as the next step beyond NUnit.

#### About This Site

This new version of the `CharliePoole.org` site is pulling together posts, articles
and other pages, which were originally scattered in various locations, including my
older `CharliePoole.org` and `Charliepoole.com` sites and several blogs. It's a work
in progress and I'll be adding "new" old stuff as well as actual new material over time.

Technically, the site is statically generated using [Statiq.Web](https://statiq.dev/web/)
along with some custom additions. The principal change that's visible to users is the use
of "Topics" in addition for posts. Topics are mutually exclusive and I intend them to make
the site easier to use for folks who may visit for different reasons. Currently, there are
only three Topics: Technical Posts, Family Photos and Family History but I plan to expand
this in the future.

To track changes in the site, you may view the [status page](/status.html).
