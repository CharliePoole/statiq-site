#### About Me

On the personal level, I'm a retired guy with four children and three grandchildren. I live
in Pouslbo, a small town across Puget Sound from Seattle. Aside from family, my interests
include Travel, Walking, Reading, Photography and Genealogy. I love languages, speak French
and Italian fairly well and dabble in a few others. When I was younger, I did a lot of sailing
and skiing as well but I'm less physically active these days.

Professionally, I've been developing software in one role or another since 1974. I started as
an employee and later became an independent consultant, trainer and coach. I've worked around
the US and in Europe and am now retired.

Beginning around 2001, I got involved in the Agile development movement, primarily
Extreme Programming. I was active in the international XP conferences and had the privilege of
learning from some of the true experts and innovators in the field.

I have been very active in Open Source, particularly with the NUnit Project, the longest-lived
project of it's type in the .NET world. These days, my focus is primarily on TestCentric, which
I intend as the next step beyond NUnit.

#### About This Site

Initially, I created this new version of the `CharliePoole.org` site to pulling together posts,
articles and other pages, which were originally scattered in various locations, including my
older `CharliePoole.org` and `Charliepoole.com` sites and several blogs.

Although I had originally intended to have my technical and personal posts in one place, that
didn't turn out to be such a great idea. The audiences for the two kinds of posts are entirely
different. So I'm now limiting this site to technical posts and articles only.

Technically, the site is statically generated using [Statiq.Web](https://statiq.dev/web/). The
site is still under development and you may view the [status page](/status.html) to track  changes.

#### About the Photo

The photo shows me and Ward Cunningham teaching a class in test-driven development. In 2003, after
the XP2003 conference in Genoa, we travelled in Italy and Sweden, programming together and conducting
several training sessions. I was an experienced programmer at the time, but very new to Extreme Programming
and Test Driven Development. Since then, I have often found myself using some idea or technique, which
I originally learned from Ward during that time.
